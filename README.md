Modular Peristaltic Pump v1.0 is still unoptimized but fully tested in a research laboratory environment.

This design allows multiple syringe pumps to be conveniently stacked and mounted on two 8 mm rods. The pumps can slide easily for precise alignment and are securely locked in place by tightening the locking screws at the bottom of the front and back modules. They can be mounted both horizontally or vertically.
PLA is fine for all the printed parts but PETG or ASA/ABS are definitely a better choice.

Both STL files and full CAD (Fusion 360) are provided.

This version is inspired by the work of A. S. Samokhin (Samokhin A.S.; Syringe Pump Created using 3D Printing Technology and Arduino Platform; J Anal Chem 75, 416â€“421 (2020); https://doi.org/10.1134/S1061934820030156), but has been completely redesigned. As a result, the parts are likely not intercompatible.
